  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  
  <h3>WTF is ChkSnd?</h3>
  <p>It is a tool to create a music video with a visual accompaniment. In a sense, it is an alternative to the Adobe After Effects, but FREE! I've developed it inspired by videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/neAMkgYta9M" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/vZv9-TWdBJM" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Where to Download?</h3>
  <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.chksndapp" target="_blank">On Google Play</a></p>
  
  <h3>Video Details</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1280x720</li>
    <li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> 25</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>App crashes while importing an audio.</h3>
  <p>It should not have been like this! Do you use any Custom ROM? If so, then sorry about the problem. While testing Google's Music and Samsung's Music players was used and there was no crashes while importing an audio. Please make a screens with your steps when App crashes and send to Twitter page <a href="https://twitter.com/aimazh">@aimazh</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>No video in gallery?</h3>
  <p>Video is actually saved in your phone under <code>/SD/Movies/ChkSnd</code>, but not scanned through any Media App. Because of that you can not find it. (Note: in the last update the problem was fixed)</p>
  
  <h3>Exporting is too slow?</h3>
  <p>Rendering is to complex for mobile platforms (aka for ChkSnd), and takes long time. It can't be reduced at the time (maybe I'll work on improving in future).</p>
